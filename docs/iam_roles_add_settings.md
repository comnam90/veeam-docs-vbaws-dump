At the Type step of the wizard, select one of the following options:

* [IAM role from current account](iam_roles_add_settings_iam.md) — select this option if you want to add an existing IAM role from the AWS account to which the backup appliance belongs.

* [IAM role from another account](iam_roles_add_settings_iam_cross_account.md) — select this option if you want to add an existing IAM role from an AWS account other than the account to which the backup appliance belongs.
* [Create new IAM role](iam_roles_add_settings_iam_new.md) — select this option if you want Veeam Backup for AWS to create a new IAM role in AWS automatically.
