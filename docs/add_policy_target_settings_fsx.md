By default, backup policies create only backups of processed FSx file systems. At the Targets step of the wizard, you can specify the following backup target settings:

* [Specify backup vaults where Veeam Backup for AWS will store FSx file system backups](add_policy_target_settings_backups_fsx.md).
* [Instruct Veeam Backup for AWS to copy FSx file system backups to other AWS Regions](add_policy_target_settings_backup_copy_fsx.md).
