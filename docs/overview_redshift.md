Veeam Backup for AWS allows you to create cloud-native backups of Redshift clusters and store them in any backup vault in the source AWS Region. An Amazon Redshift backup captures the whole image of the Redshift cluster at a specific point of time. Redshift backups are taken using native [AWS capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-aws-backup.html).

To protect Redshift clusters, Veeam Backup for AWS runs backup policies. A backup policy is a collection of settings that define the way backup operations are performed: what data to back up, where to store backups, when to start the backup process, how to retain restore points, and so on.

Veeam Backup for AWS does not install agent software inside instances to back up Redshift clusters — it uses native AWS capabilities instead. During every backup session, Veeam Backup for AWS creates a cloud-native backup for each cluster added to a backup policy. For more information on how Redshift clusters backup works, see [Redshift Clusters Backup](backup_hiw_redshift.md).

How To Protect Redshift Clusters

To create a Redshift policy, perform the following steps:

1. [Check limitations and prerequisites](limitations.md#backup_redshift).
2. [Specify IAM roles to access AWS services and resources](accounts_iam_roles.md).
3. [[Optional] Configure global retention settings for obsolete session records](retention_settings.md#sessions).
4. [[Optional] Configure email notification settings for automated delivery of backup policy results and daily reports](email_settings.md).
5. [Complete the Add Redshift Policy wizard](policies_create_redshift.md).
