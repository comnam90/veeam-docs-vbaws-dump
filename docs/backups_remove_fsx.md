In this article

Veeam Backup for AWS applies the [configured retention policy settings](add_policy_schedule_retention_fsx.md) to automatically remove FSx file system backups and backup copies created by backup policies. If necessary, you can also remove the backed-up data manually.

To remove backed-up data manually, do the following:

1. Navigate to Protected Data > File Systems > FSx.
2. Select FSx file systems whose data you want to remove.
3. Click Remove and select either of the following options:

* Backups — to remove FSx backups created for the selected file systems by backup policies.
* Backup Copies — to remove backup copies created for the selected file systems by backup policies.
* Manual Backups — to remove FSx backups created for the selected file systems manually.

If you want to remove only specific manual backup, follow the instructions provided in section [Removing FSx Backups Created Manually](backups_remove_individual_fsx.md).

* All — to remove all backups and backup copies created for the selected file systems both by backup policies and manually.
