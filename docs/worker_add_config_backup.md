By default, Veeam Backup for AWS deploys worker instances in the backup account to perform retention tasks, to execute EC2 backup and EC2 restore operations, and to create RDS archived backups. You can [choose an IAM role](worker_role_backup.md) and [specify network settings](worker_configurations_backup.md#region) that will be used to deploy these worker instances.
