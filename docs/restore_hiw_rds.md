Veeam Backup for AWS offers the following restore operations:

* [RDS instance restore](restore_hiw_rds_instance.md) — restores an entire DB instance or an Aurora DB cluster from a cloud-native snapshot or snapshot replica.
* [Database restore](restore_hiw_rds_database.md) — restores specific databases of Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL DB instances from an image-level backup.

You can restore RDS instance data to the most recent state or to any available restore point.
