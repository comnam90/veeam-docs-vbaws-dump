To be able to perform data protection and disaster recovery operations with AWS resources that belong to AWS accounts within an AWS Organization, you can add the AWS Organization to Veeam Backup for AWS and specify IAM roles whose permissions will be used to perform these operations. To help you configure the necessary IAM roles in AWS and grant all the required permissions, Veeam Backup for AWS allows you to [create IAM roles templates](organization_template_add.md).
