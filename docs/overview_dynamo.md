With Veeam Backup for AWS, you can perform the following operations to protect DynamoDB tables:

* Create cloud-native backups of DynamoDB tables and store them in any backup vault in the source AWS Region.

An Amazon DynamoDB backup captures the whole image of the DynamoDB table at a specific point of time. DynamoDB backups are taken using native [AWS capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/CreateBackupAWS.html).

* Create backup copies of DynamoDB tables and store them in any AWS Region within the same AWS account.

By default, DynamoDB backups are stored only in the AWS Region where the processed resources reside. For enhanced data safety, you can instruct Veeam Backup for AWS to create copies of these backups and store them in any other AWS Region within the same AWS account.

To protect DynamoDB tables, Veeam Backup for AWS runs backup policies. A backup policy is a collection of settings that define the way backup operations are performed: what data to back up, where to store backups, when to start the backup process, how to retain restore points, and so on.

Veeam Backup for AWS does not install agent software inside instances to back up DynamoDB tables — it uses native AWS capabilities instead. During every backup session, Veeam Backup for AWS creates a cloud-native backup for each table added to a backup policy. The cloud-native backup is further used to create a backup copy in another AWS Region. For more information on how DynamoDB table backup works, see [DynamoDB Backup](backup_hiw_dynamo.md).

How To Protect DynamoDB Tables

To create a DynamoDB policy, perform the following steps:

1. [Check limitations and prerequisites](limitations.md#backup_dynamo).
2. [Specify IAM roles to access AWS services and resources](accounts_iam_roles.md).
3. [[Optional] Configure global retention settings for obsolete session records](retention_settings.md#sessions).
4. [[Optional] Configure email notification settings for automated delivery of backup policy results and daily reports](email_settings.md).
5. [Complete the Add DynamoDB Policy wizard](policies_create_dynamo.md).
