Security groups associated with shared subnets are not automatically propagated to other AWS accounts during resource sharing. That is why if you have created a single resource share in one AWS account for all subnets to which worker instances will be connected, you must create security groups in each production account — these groups will be associated with worker instances connected to the shared subnets.

To create a security group, do the following:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using credentials of an AWS account in which you want to create the security group.
2. Navigate to Services > Networking & Content Delivery and click VPC.
3. In the VPC console, navigate to Security > Security Groups and click Create security group.
4. Complete the Create security group wizard:

1. At the Basic details step, do the following:

1. In the Security group name and Description field, specify a name and description for the security group.
2. In the VPC field, specify the ID of the VPC in which you want to create the security group.

To obtain the ID, you can look it up on the Your VPCs page in the VPC console.

1. At the Inbound rules step, do not specify any inbound rules.
2. At the Outbound rules step, specify rules to allow outbound HTTPS trafficto all VPC endpoints used by worker instances that will be connected to the shared subnets through port 443.
3. At the Tags step, specify AWS tags that will be assigned to the security group.
4. Click Create security group.

| Important |
| After you create a security group, you must either add a new worker configuration or edit the network settings of an existing one to specify the created security group for each production account in which worker instances will be deployed. To learn how to do that, see [Adding Configurations for Production Accounts](worker_add_config_prod.md#region). |
