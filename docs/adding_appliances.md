In this article

After you install Veeam Plug-In for AWS, you must add backup appliances to the backup infrastructure. To do that, use either of the following options:

* [Deploy new Veeam Backup for AWS appliances](deploying_appliances.md) from the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
* [Connect to existing Veeam Backup for AWS appliances](connect_appliance.md) if you have already deployed them.

| Note |
| One backup appliance can be managed by one backup server only. If you add the appliance to the backup infrastructure of another backup server, the synchronization between the appliance and the previous backup server will be terminated, and appliance will be displayed as unavailable. |
