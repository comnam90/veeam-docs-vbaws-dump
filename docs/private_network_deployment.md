The private deployment feature allows you to increase the security of your environment by retaining network traffic within a private network.

With Veeam Backup for AWS, you can deploy [backup appliances](backup_appliances.md) and [worker instances](worker_instances.md) in a private environment. However, it is not necessary that all these components are connected to a private network — you can configure the backup infrastructure the way that suits your security concerns best.
