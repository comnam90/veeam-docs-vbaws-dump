As Veeam Plug-In for AWS is installed on the same machine where Veeam Backup & Replication runs, it uses the same ports as those described in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Ports](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/used_ports.html?ver=13). In addition, the Veeam Backup for AWS architecture components require the ports listed in the following table.

| From | To | Protocol | Port | Notes |

| TCP/HTTPS | 11005 | [Optional] Default port required to communicate with the public REST API service running on the backup appliance. For more information on Veeam Backup for AWS REST API, see the [Veeam Backup for AWS REST API Reference](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbaws/9/rest/1.7-rev0/tag/SectionAbout).  To learn how to change the port number, see the [Configuring Security Settings](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/references/vbaws/9/rest/1.7-rev0/tag/SectionOverview#section/Configuring-Security-Settings) section in the Veeam Backup for AWS REST API Reference. |

To open network ports, you must add rules to security groups associated with Veeam Backup for AWS components:

* A security group associated with the backup appliance. For more information, see [Deploying Appliance from Console](deploy_network_resources.md).
* Security groups associated with worker instances. For more information, see [Managing Worker Configurations](worker_settings.md).

To learn how to add security groups rules, see [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html).
