3. In the Customer gateway section, select the Existing option and specify the ID of the customer gateway.

| Tip |
| When you create a VPN connection, AWS generates a sample configuration file that can be further used to configure a customer gateway device. To download the file, do the following:   1. In the Amazon VPC console, navigate to Virtual Private Network > Site-to-Site VPN Connections. 2. From the VPN connections drop-down list, select the created connection and click Download configuration.  1. In the Download configuration window, select the vendor, class and operating system of the customer gateway device, and the IKE version that is used for the VPN connection. Then, click Download.   To learn how to configure a customer gateway device, see [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.html). |
