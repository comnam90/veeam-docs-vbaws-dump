In this article

You can back up and restore the configuration database that stores data collected from Veeam Backup for AWS for the existing backup policies, protected AWS resources, created worker instance configurations and profiles, added IAM roles and users, logged session records and so on. If a backup appliance goes down for some reason, you can quickly restore its configuration from the configuration backup. You can also use configuration backups to apply the configuration of one backup appliance to another one in the backup infrastructure. For more information, see [Performing Configuration Backup and Restore](config_backup.md).

For application-related errors and issues, refer to the [Veeam Knowledge Base](https://www.veeam.com/knowledge-base.html) or consider opening a [support ticket](https://www.veeam.com/support.html).
