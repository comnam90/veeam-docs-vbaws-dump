Veeam Backup for AWS allows you to simplify data protection and monitor compliance with your target SLA by configuring [SLA-based backup policies](sla_policies.md). An SLA-based backup policy is a collection of settings that automate the way backup operations are performed: how frequently to run the backup process, what region-specific repositories to use to store backups, how many restore points should be created in time to meet SLA requirements, and so on.

To configure an SLA-based backup policy, you must first add an SLA template and a storage template to your backup appliance.
