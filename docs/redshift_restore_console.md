You can recover corrupted Redshift clusters in the Veeam Backup for AWS Web UI only. However, you can launch the Redshift Cluster Restore wizard directly from the Veeam Backup & Replication console to start the restore operation:

1. In the Veeam Backup & Replication console, open the Home view.
2. Navigate to Backups > Snapshots.
3. Expand the backup policy that protects the Redshift clusters you want to recover, select the necessary cluster and click Amazon Redshift on the ribbon.

Alternatively, you can right-click the selected cluster and click Restore to Amazon Redshift.

| Important |
| You cannot restore multiple Redshift clusters from the Veeam Backup & Replication console. |

Veeam Backup & Replication will open the Redshift Cluster Restore wizard in a web browser. Complete the wizard as described in section [Redshift Restore Using Web UI](restore_point_redshift.md).
