To recover files and folders of a backed-up EC2 instance, Veeam Backup for AWS performs the following steps:

1. Deploys a worker instance in either of the following AWS Regions:

* To restore files and folders from a cloud-native snapshot, manual cloud-native snapshots or a snapshot replicas, Veeam Backup for AWS deploys the worker instance in the AWS Region where the source EC2 snapshot or snapshot replica resides.
* To restore files and folders from an image-level backup, Veeam Backup for AWS deploys the worker instance in the AWS Region where the backup repository with backed-up data resides.

1. Attaches and mounts EBS volumes of the EC2 instance to the worker instance.

[Applies only if you restore files and folders from an image-level backup] EBS volumes are not physically extracted from the backup — Veeam Backup for AWS emulates their presence on the worker instance. The source backup itself remains in the read-only state.

1. [Applies only if you perform restore to the original location] Installs the Veeam restore tool on the source EC2 instance.
2. Launches the file-level recovery browser.

The file-level recovery browser displays the file system tree of the backed-up EC2 instance. In the browser, you can select the necessary files and folders to restore.

1. Downloads the selected files and folders to the local machine.
2. [Applies only if you perform restore to the original location] Restores the selected files and folders to the source EC2 instance, or downloads them to the local machine.
3. Unmounts and detaches EBS volumes of the backed-up EC2 instance from the worker instance.
4. [Applies only if you perform restore to the original location] Removes the Veeam restore tool from the source EC2 instance.
5. Removes the worker instance from Amazon EC2.
