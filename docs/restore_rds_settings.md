| The Settings step also contains some preconfigured settings retrieved from the source RDS resources. If you want to specify advanced configuration settings for a restored DB instance or Aurora DB cluster, select the necessary resource and click Advanced Options. For more information on all available settings that can be specified for RDS resources, see the [Amazon RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html#USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings) and [Amazon Aurora User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html#Aurora.CreateInstance.Settings). |
