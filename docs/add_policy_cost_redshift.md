[This step applies only if you have created a schedule for the backup policy at the Schedule step of the wizard]

At the Cost Estimation step of the wizard, review the estimated monthly cost of AWS services and resources that will be consumed to protect the clusters added to the backup policy.

The total estimated cost includes the cost of creating backups of the Redshift clusters. For each cluster included in the backup policy, Veeam Backup for AWS takes into account the number of restore points to be kept in the backup chain and the configured scheduling settings.

| Note |
| To calculate the estimated cost, Veeam Backup for AWS uses the capabilities of the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/?key=new) that estimates the cost of services in USD only. This calculator is intended for informational and estimation purposes only. |

The estimated cost may occur to be significantly higher due to the backup frequency and AWS backup charges. To reduce the cost, you can try the following workarounds:

* To reduce high AWS backup charges, adjust the backup retention settings to keep less restore points in the backup chain.
* To optimize the cost of storing backups, configure the scheduling settings to run the backup policy less frequently.

| Tip |
| You can save the cost estimation as a .CSV or .XML file. To do that, click Export to and select the necessary format. |
