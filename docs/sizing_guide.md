In this article

This section is intended for professionals who search for a best practice answer to sizing-related issues, and assumes you have already read the whole Veeam Backup for AWS User Guide.

Be aware that a best practice is not the only answer available. It will fit in the majority of cases but can also be totally wrong under different circumstances. Make sure you understand the implications of the recommended practices, or request assistance. If in doubt, reach out to Veeam professionals on [Veeam R&D Forums](https://forums.veeam.com/veeam-backup-for-aws-f55/).

| You must also consider the [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) associated with your AWS accounts, as well as the performance of [AWS instances of specific types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). Some of the options may look good; however, make sure to take into account disk size, speed and burst credits. |
