Veeam Backup for AWS allows you to create cloud-native backups of Redshift Serverless namespaces and store them in the source AWS Region. An Amazon Redshift Serverless backup captures the data of the processed Redshift Serverless namespace and its associated workgroup at a specific point of time. Redshift Serverless backups are taken using native [AWS capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-snapshots-recovery-points.html).

To protect Redshift Serverless namespaces, Veeam Backup for AWS runs backup policies. A backup policy is a collection of settings that define the way backup operations are performed: what data to back up, when to start the backup process, how to retain restore points, and so on. During every backup session, Veeam Backup for AWS creates a cloud-native backup for each namespace added to a backup policy. For more information on how Redshift Serverless namespaces backup works, see [Redshift Serverless Backup](backup_hiw_redshift_serverless.md).

Veeam Backup for AWS does not install agent software inside instances to back up Redshift Serverless namespaces — it uses native AWS capabilities instead. During every backup session, Veeam Backup for AWS creates a cloud-native backup for each namespace added to a backup policy. For more information on how Redshift Serverless namespaces backup works, see [Redshift Serverless Backup](backup_hiw_redshift_serverless.md).
