With Veeam Backup for AWS, you can perform the following operations to protect FSx file systems:

* Create cloud-native backups of FSx file systems and store them in any backup vault in the source AWS Region.

An Amazon FSx file system backup captures the whole image of the FSx file system (including file system configuration, files, directories and so on) at a specific point of time. FSx backups are taken using native [AWS capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html#supported-resources).

* Create backup copies of FSx file systems and store them in AWS Regions within the same AWS account.

By default, FSx backups are stored only in the AWS Region where the processed resources reside. For enhanced data safety, you can instruct Veeam Backup for AWS to create copies of these backups and store them in any other [default AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/opt-in-region-considerations.html) (that is, an AWS Region activated by default for your AWS account) within the same AWS account.

To protect FSx file systems, Veeam Backup for AWS runs backup policies. A backup policy is a collection of settings that define the way backup operations are performed: what data to back up, where to store backups, when to start the backup process, how to retain restore points, and so on.

Veeam Backup for AWS does not install agent software inside instances to back up FSx file systems — it uses native AWS capabilities instead. During every backup session, Veeam Backup for AWS creates a cloud-native backup for each file system added to a backup policy. The cloud-native backup is further used to create a backup copy in another AWS Region.

How To Protect FSx File Systems

To create an FSx backup policy, perform the following steps:

1. [Check limitations and prerequisites](limitations.md#backup_fsx).
2. [Specify IAM roles to access AWS services and resources](accounts_iam_roles.md).
3. [[Optional] Configure email notification settings for automated delivery of backup policy results and daily reports](email_settings.md).
4. [Complete the Add FSx Policy wizard](policies_create_fsx.md).
